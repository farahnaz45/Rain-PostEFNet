# Rain-PostEFnet

 

## Overview

Accurate precipitation forecasting is essential for
disaster preparedness, water resource management, and climate
modeling. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, while
extensively utilized, suffer from inherent limitations such as
systematic biases, coarse spatial resolution, and difficulty in ac-
curately predicting extreme rainfall events. Deep learning-based
post-processing has emerged as a promising approach to refine
NWP outputs; however, existing methods struggle with effectively
capturing multi-scale meteorological features and addressing
severe class imbalances in extreme precipitation predictions.
To overcome these challenges, we propose Rain-PostEFNet, a
deep learning framework designed for post-processing NWP
precipitation forecasts. The model integrates EfficientNet for
feature extraction, ECA-Net for adaptive channel attention, and
FPN-Swin-Unet for multi-scale feature refinement, along with a
multi-task learning strategy that jointly optimizes classification
and regression tasks using weighted focal loss and MSE loss. We
evaluate our approach on the PostRainBench datasets (China,
Germany, Korea) using Critical Success Index (CSI), Heidke
Skill Score (HSS), and Accuracy (ACC) as evaluation metrics.
Experimental results demonstrate that Rain-PostEFNet surpasses
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving CSI improvements of 63.94%
(China), 4.28% (Germany), and 2.1% (Korea) for moderate
rain classification, and 78.34% (China), 9.09% (Germany), and
7.68% (Korea) for heavy rain classification. Similarly, HSS scores
improve by 52.18% in China and 2.95% in Germany for rain,
and by 52.4% in China and 6.78% in Germany for heavy rain.
Additionally, an ablation study further confirms the impact of
the multi-task learning framework and attention mechanisms in
refining NWP predictions.

## Code

Conda Environment

```
conda env create --file enviromental.yml
conda activate PRBench
```

For model training

```
bash scripts/SwinUnet_CAMT.sh
```

Key components of our model are encapsulated in:

- `/model/swinunet_model.py`: Defines the `SwinUnet_CAM_Two` class, incorporating the SwinUnet architecture, multi-task learning heads, and the Channel Attention Module.
- `losses.py`: Including the weighted loss and multi-task learning loss functions.
